= Customizing

Anyone really wants to do it? It's not that ready for now.

== Configuration

Custom file structure: see https://docs.rs/adbook/latest/adbook/book/config/struct.BookRon.html[BookRon] (and https://docs.rs/adbook/latest/adbook/book/config/struct.TocRon.html[TocRon]).

== Custom Handlebars template

`adbook` converts each `.adoc` file by running `asciidoctor` and then applies a Handlebars template (if it's specified).

All Handlebars templates should be located in one directory, say, `hbs`. Partial files should be under `hbs/partials` and they're loaded before running Handlebars.

=== Special document attributes

`adbook` treats `hbs` document attribute as the path to a Handlebars template file relative to the source directory.

So we can do this:

[source,adoc]
----
= Title
:hbs: theme/hbs/my_cool_template.hbs
----

=== Template data

`HbsData` in https://docs.rs/adbook/latest/adbook/build/convert/hbs.html[hbs.rs] is supplied to Handlebars template.

More data? Hmm..
