= Customizing

`adbook` converts each `.adoc` file by running `asciidoctor` and then applies a Handlebars template (if it's specified).

== Configuration

=== Special attributes

`adbook` treats `hbs` document attribute as the path to a Handlebars template file relative to the source directory.

=== Custom file structure

Anyone really wants to do that?

== Custom Handlebars template

`HbsData` in https://docs.rs/adbook/latest/adbook/build/convert/hbs.html[hbs.rs] is supplied to Handlebars template.
