= Customizing

== About

=== Configuration

Please refer to https://github.com/toyboot4e/adbook/tree/gh-pages[the source files] of this demo site.

=== Custom Handlebars template

`adbook` converts each `.adoc` file by running `asciidoctor` and then applying a Handlebars template (if it's specified).

==== Template data

https://docs.rs/adbook/latest/adbook/build/convert/hbs/struct.HbsData.html[HbsData] in https://docs.rs/adbook/latest/adbook/build/convert/hbs/index.html[hbs.rs] is supplied to Handlebars templates.

Custom data is NOT available (you'll have to modify the source directly).

==== Location of template files

All Handlebars templates should be located in one directory, say, `hbs`. Partial files have to be under the `hbs/partials` and they're loaded before running Handlebars.

==== The `hbs` document attribute

`adbook` treats `hbs` document attribute as the path to a Handlebars template file relative to the source directory.

So we can do this:

[source,adoc]
----
= Title
:hbs: theme/hbs/my_cool_template.hbs
// All partial templates must be located in `theme/hbs/patials` in this case
----
