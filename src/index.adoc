= adbook

`adbook` is a tool for building book-like webpages. If you like this demo, you might like `adbook`, too.

== Installation

=== Rust & adbook

If you have https://play.rust-lang.org/[Rust], `adbook` is available via Crates.io:

[source,bash]
----
$ cargo install adbook # -> $HOME/.cargo/bin
----

=== Ruby & Asciidoctor

You need Ruby and some package manager. I recommend https://rvm.io/[RVM] because programs installed with it runed faster than that were with `rbenv` (somehow).

Then let's get Asciidoctor gems:

[source,bash]
----
$ rvm install asciidoctor
$ rvm install asciidoctor-diagram
----

We're ready!

== Overview

=== Usage

Let's make a new book:

[source,bash]
----
$ adbook init my-book
Initialized a new adbook project at my-book
----

And see the files:

[source,bash]
----
$ tree my-book -L 2
tmp
├── book.ron // <1>
├── site // <2>
└── src // <3>
    ├── article.adoc
    ├── index.adoc
    ├── static
    │   └── img
    ├── theme
    │   ├── css
    │   ├── hbs
    │   └── js
    └── toc.ron

8 directories, 4 files
----
<1> `book.ron` is a base configuration file that maps to https://docs.rs/adbook/0.1.0/adbook/book/config/struct.BookRon.html[BookRon]
<2> The site directory, where `adbook` outputs files
<3> The source directory, which is basically mapped to the site directory

`adbook` maps files from source directory to site directory, converting `.adoc` files to html files. To generate html files, {adoc} and {handlebars} templates are used.

=== Differences from mdbook

{adbook} is highly inspired by {mdbook}, but it uses https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] for source files instead of Markdown.

Other differences:

* `adbook` uses Prism.js to highlight source files.
* `adbook` can't enjoy Rust playground.
* `adbook` doesn't provide hidden source files (so copy some template to get started).

=== Differences from raw `asciidoctor` command

* `asciidoctor` does not create multiple page website.
* `adbook` provides some placeholder strings to _document attributes_, such as `{base_url}`.
