= Demos

You can nest directories as this!

`toc.ron` in this directory is:

[source,toml]
----
include::demos/toc.ron[]
----

TIP: Titles can be skipped as this: `File("", "demo.adoc")`. Then it is automatically extracted from the AsciiDoc file.

// Prism.js can't highlight `ron` so I'm using toml instead
