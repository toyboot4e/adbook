= Demos

== This is `demos/index.adoc`

`index.ron` in this directory is:

[source,toml]
----
include::demos/index.ron[]
----

TIP: Titles can be skipped as this: `File("", "demo.adoc")`. Then it is automatically extracted from the AsciiDoc file.

// Prism.js can't highlight `ron` so I'm using toml instead
